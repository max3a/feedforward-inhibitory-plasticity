# feedforward-inhibitory-plasticity
C++ code for the paper "Rational designing of oscillatory rhythmicity for memory rescue in plasticity-impaired learning networks". You need a gnu complier, and RandNum.h and run.h provided whitin this repository to run the program.

In main.cpp, you can decide 
    -the recording time period of synaptic current, t_record. 
    -Able/disable feedforward E->I plasticity, LTP.
    -the theta, and gamma frequency and number of pulses applied within one theta period during rescue when feedforward E->I plasticity is not disabled, theta, gamma,                  pulse_number.
