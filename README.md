# feedforward-inhibitory-plasticity
C++ code for the paper "Rational designing of oscillatory rhythmicity for memory rescue in plasticity-impaired learning networks". You need a gnu complier, and RandNum.h (from http://www.math.sci.hiroshima-u.ac.jp/~m-mat/MT/emt.html) and run.h provided whitin this repository to run the program.

The model circuit is composed of two layers (L1, L2), each with 2000 excitatory neurons and 400 inhibitory neurons, and probability 0.2, the neurons were randomly connected within each layer L1 and L2, and from L1 excitatory neurons to both L2 excitatory neurons and feedforward inhibitory neurons (FF Inh, 200 neurons) in L2. In L2, the FF Inh neurons were also uni-directionally connected to the recurrent inhibitory (Re Inh, 200 neurons) neurons in L2.
The neurons are labelled as:
* 0-1999 L1 excitatory neurons;
* 2000-2399 L2 inhibitory neurons;
* 2400-2799 unused; 
* 2800-4799 L2 excitatory neurons; 
* 4800-4999 L2 Re inh neurons; 
* 5000-5199 FF inh neurons.

and each layer is a model of learning circuit. The model used in this work is composed of conductance-based integrate-and-fire neurons, short-term depression and long-term plasticity, and the parameters used are biologically plausible, justified in previous works (Brunel and Wang, 2003; Dayan and Abbott, 2005; Hempel et al., 2000; Markram et al., 1998; Mongillo et al., 2008; Pfister and Gerstner, 2006). In particular, each layer has 2000 excitatory neurons, and 400 inhibitory neurons, n_I. Each neuron in L1 and L2 received background input from 400 independent Poisson trains. L1 neurons received extra theta input periodically. For more details, Please refer to the method of the paper.

In main.cpp, you can decide 
- the time interval between two recordings, t_record. 
- Able/disable feedforward E->I plasticity, LTP.
- the theta, and gamma frequency and number of pulses applied within one theta period during rescue when feedforward E->I plasticity is not disabled, theta, gamma, pulse_number. 
- the numbering of the simulation, count

To run the simulation, you can run cmd in window, go to the directory folder and type mingw32-make. It will generate an exe, named "main.exe".

By running "main.exe", 9 txt files will be generated, which are
- E=3.00I=8.00P=0.20_spike_{count}\_0_0.00.txt (with feedforward E->I plasticity) or E=3.00I=8.00P=0.20_spike_{count}_0_0.50.txt (without feedforward E->I plasticity)
	>The txt has 2 columns, which are the spike time and neuron label (Each neuron has its unique label). i.e. 0-1999 are L1 excitatory neurons; 2000-2399 are L1 inhibitory neurons; 2800-4799 are L2 excitatory neurons; 4800-4999 are L2 Re inh neurons; 5000-5199 are FF inh neurons.
- text_{count}_RE_AMPA.txt
	>The txt has 2401 colums. The 1st column is running time of simulation in unit ms. The 2-2401 columns are the recurrent AMPA current recived by neurons labelled with (column number+1998). i.e. column number 2-2001 are L2 excitatory neurons (Neuron labels are 2800-4799); column number 2002-2201 are L2 Re inh neurons (Neuron labels are 4800-4999); column number 2202-2401 are FF inh neurons (Neuron labels are 5000-5199).
- text_{count}\_RE_NMDA.txt
	>Same as text_{count}_RE_AMPA.txt, but the 2-2401 columns are recurrent NMDA current.
- text_{count}\_FF_AMPA.txt
	>Same as text_{count}_RE_AMPA.txt, but the 2-2401 columns are feedforward NMDA current.
- text_{count}\_FF_NMDA.txt
	>Same as text_{count}_RE_AMPA.txt, but the 2-2401 columns are feedforward NMDA current.
- text_{count}\_FF_GABA.txt
	>Same as text_{count}_RE_AMPA.txt, but the 2-2401 columns are recurrent GABA current.
- text_{count}\_V.txt
	>Same as text_{count}_RE_AMPA.txt, but the 2-2401 columns are membrane potential of neurons.
- E=3.00I=8.00P=0.20_W_{count}\_0_0.00.txt (with feedforward E->I plasticity) or E=3.00I=8.00P=0.20_W_{count}\_0_0.50.txt (without feedforward E->I plasticity)
	>A matrix representing the final synaptic weights after learning. Each number of the matrix is the synaptic weight from the neuron with label (column number -1) to neuron with label (row number -1).
